## Summary 

Based on the analysis we can see that there is not a positivity bias from reviews in the Vine program. We can see that Vine reviews reresent a small proportion of overall reviews. With roughly 40% of the Vine reviews being 5-stars. We can see that there are almost 50 x the amount of reviews for non-Vine reviews. With almost half of the reviews being 5-stars. If we were looking for a positivity bias we would assume either the majority of reviews come from Vine members or the majority of positive reviews from Vine members are positive. Additional analysis on the 5-star scale would give us additional insight into an overall positivity bias. Just because a Vine member doesn't rate the product 5-stars doesn't mean they shy away from giving it a 4- or 3- star rating making the review overall positive.
